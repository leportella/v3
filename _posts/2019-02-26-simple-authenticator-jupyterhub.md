In this post I'll tell you about the new [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) authenticator I implemented in the last couple of months, not only technically but also the context in which it was built. If you have no idea what JupyterHub is and how it works, I recommend [this short talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GJFNQBB26s&t=973s) by the awesome [Carol Willing](https://twitter.com/WillingCarol) 🙃.

But first things first, let me introduce myself! My name is [Leticia](https://leportella.com/) and I'm Brazilian 🇧🇷. Last year (2018) I saw an opening for an internship program called [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/). I am a woman, a self-taught programmer with a non traditional background ([I'm an oceanographer](https://leportella.com/english/2016/03/16/from-oceanographer-to-programmer.html)) and I had no job at this time. The program would fit me perfectly. Lucky me, Jupyter was one of the projects available! Thus, everything you'll see here is the result (so far) of everything I've been doing with the internship and the help of my mentors.
